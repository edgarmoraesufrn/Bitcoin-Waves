# Bitcoin-Waves
A linear combination for price modeling

Bitcoin has received much attention in recent years due to its properties, which offer instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Probably, this technology is the biggest invention of our generation. However, what is the real value of bitcoin?
A genius man known as Plan B modeled the price of bitcoin based on the scarcity of bitcoin. He inspired me to find a model of bitcoin price. Thank you very much.
This report presents a new method for modeling bitcoin price. On the basis of halving waves, it then describes the movement of the market using linear combination.

Up to date, there were three bitcoin waves. The first wave started on the famous “pizza day” and ended on the first halving (2010 > 2012). The second wave occurred between first and second halvings (2012 > 2016) and third wave between second and third halvings (2016 > 2020).
